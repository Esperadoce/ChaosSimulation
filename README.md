# Double Pendulum & Chaos Simulations

This project is a collection of interactive chaos and physics simulations built with React, including:

- **Double Pendulum** (default page, with dual-canvas comparison and full parameter controls)
- Lorenz Attractor
- Three-Body Problem
- Mandelbrot Set (WebGL accelerated)

## Features
- Modern, minimal UI
- Real-time, interactive controls for all parameters
- Compare two double pendulums with independent initial angles
- GPU-accelerated Mandelbrot fractal
- All code written in JavaScript/React
